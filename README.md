# CShell

A simple shell clone written in C languages as a part of my Computing Lab course assignment. It supports basic commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `ls`, `cat`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `cp`, `exit`, etc. It also supports piping.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the code using `gcc -o cshell cshell.c`
3. Run the executable using `./cshell`

## How to use

1. The shell will prompt you for a command.
2. Enter the command and press enter.
3. The shell will execute the command and prompt you for another command.
4. To exit the shell, enter `exit`.
